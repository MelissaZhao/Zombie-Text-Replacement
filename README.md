Aims to apply abstraction and decomposition to solve more complex problems

Qualifying statement:
Learners are able to work on larger problems. They are able to simplify and break down larger problems, making use of abstraction and decomposition, as well as more complex reusable data structures.

Example outcomes:
* Can decompose a large problem into parts and design algorithms to solve them
* Can recognise similar problems, and apply generic solutions and abstractions
* Can effectively combine functionality from multiple libraries or APIs and refer to documentation
* Can write code in a readable way, and/or includes comments where necessary

Example projects
* Dress for the weather (Python)
* Flappy astronaut (Python, Raspberry Pi, Sense HAT)
* Getting started with the Twitter API (Python)
